# ♻️ Recyclify: A Smart Waste Classification App
Deep Learning-powered waste classification with real-time Streamlit web app and LLM-based chatbot support.

---

## 📖 About

This project aims to automate **waste classification** into categories like organic, recyclable, etc., using deep learning (MobileNetV2) and provide a **user-friendly web application** built with Streamlit.  
It also integrates a **GROQ LLM-based chatbot** for any real-time assistance regarding waste segregation.

---

## ✨ Features

- 🔥 Train lightweight MobileNetV2 model for classification
- 🖼️ Predict waste type from uploaded or URL-based images
- 🤖 Chatbot integration for real-time waste management queries
- 📈 Visualize training history (accuracy/loss graphs)
- 🗃️ Dataset reorganization utility
- 🌐 Easy to deploy Streamlit web app

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Streamlit
- **Backend:** TensorFlow, Python
- **Model:** MobileNetV2 (Pretrained)
- **LLM:** GROQ (via API)
- **Miscellaneous:** Pillow, Numpy, Requests, Tqdm, Matplotlib

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/smart-waste-classification.git
cd smart-waste-classification
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install Requirements

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Add `.env` File

Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your GROQ API Key:

```bash
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
```

### 5. Train the Model (Optional)

If you wish to train your own model:

- Run `train_model.ipynb` notebook.
- Save the trained model as `waste_model.h5` in the root directory.

### 6. Run the Streamlit App

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Upload an image or provide an image URL.
2. The model will predict the waste category.
3. Chat with the integrated LLM for advice or doubts.
4. View training graphs and model performance.

# 🔥 Pro Tips for an even better README:

- Add a **top badge** like:
  ```markdown
  ![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)
  ![Python Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3.9+-blue.svg)
  ```
- Create a short **demo video (~20-30 sec)** and embed it.
- Upload your **screenshots/GIFs inside an `assets/` folder**.
- Create a proper `.gitignore` to avoid uploading unnecessary files (like model checkpoints, env files).

Would you also like me to create a ready-to-paste `.gitignore` file? 🚀 It’ll help clean your repo too.
